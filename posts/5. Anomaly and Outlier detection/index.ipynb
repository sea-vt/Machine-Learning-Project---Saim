        "\n",
        "Anomaly or outlier detection is a crucial aspect of data analysis in machine learning, focusing on identifying data points that significantly differ from the majority of the data. One effective method for anomaly detection is the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. This blog post explores DBSCAN's role in outlier detection with two practical examples.\n",

        "## **Understanding DBSCAN in Anomaly Detection**\n",
        "\n",
        "DBSCAN is particularly well-suited for anomaly detection due to its ability to find outliers in a dataset based on density. Unlike many clustering algorithms, DBSCAN does not require pre-specifying the number of clusters. It groups together points that are closely packed together and marks as outliers the points that lie alone in low-density regions.\n",
