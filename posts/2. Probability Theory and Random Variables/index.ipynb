        "In this code, we start by generating a set of random data points that follow a normal distribution. We then apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. KDE is particularly useful in machine learning for understanding the underlying distribution of data. The plot includes both a histogram of the data and the KDE, providing a visual comparison of the data distribution and the KDE model.\n",
